"""A Range origin that answers the way a HOST PROXY does, for PRISMCORE_BENCH.

Aether does not hand the engine a server URL: SMB, WebDAV and Wellspring
sources go through a localhost range proxy, and that proxy fetches each
forwarded window WHOLE before it writes a byte. FFmpeg's HTTP asks for
`bytes=N-`, so an open and every backward seek wait for a full bite of the
proxy's chunk size, however few bytes the demuxer actually wanted. A normal
Range server answers immediately and hides the entire cost — which is how a
startup that takes 18 s on a device benchmarks at 60 ms here.

    CHUNK_BYTES=8388608 RATE_BPS=800000 python3 Scripts/proxy-model-server.py movie.mkv 8732
    PRISMCORE_BENCH=http://127.0.0.1:8732/movie.mkv swift test --filter checkpointLine

CHUNK_BYTES is the proxy's forwarded window (8 MB is Aether's), RATE_BPS the
origin's throughput behind it, RTT_MS one round trip, REQLOG a file to record
each request in — the count is the number that matters.

VALIDATOR=1 adds an ETag (from the file's size and mtime) to every response.
Off by default, because the proxy it models forwards none — and without one
`PrismCoreEngine.prewarm` refuses to store anything. On, it models a proxy
that passes its origin's validator through, which is what a prewarm needs:
