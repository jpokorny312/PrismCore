/// (`info`) and the **open context that produced it**.
///
/// A playback used to open its source twice: the host probes to decide how to
/// play, then the remuxer opens again to produce. Over a network that second
/// open is a real round trip and a real download — measured at a median of
/// 54 ms even capped, on a link with no latency at all — and it happens inside
/// the wait a user is watching.
///
/// The tempting shortcut is to keep the first open's *conclusions* and let the
/// second context skip its analysis. That was tried in 1.1.2 and reverted:
/// `avformat_find_stream_info` also fills fields the **muxer** needs (an EAC3
/// track's frame size, most sharply), so a context that never ran it produces
/// a correct-looking manifest and a failing `av_interleaved_write_frame`. The
/// analysis isn't redundant knowledge — it is state that lives in the context.
///
/// So the context itself moves. `consumeContext()` hands it over exactly once;
/// whoever takes it owns closing it, and a `ProbedSource` that is never
/// consumed (the host declined the source, or never started a session) closes
/// its own on the way out.
///
/// **Threading**: an `AVFormatContext` is not safe for concurrent use, and this
/// deliberately does not make it so. The handover is a *move* across threads —
/// the probing side must be finished with it, which consuming it exactly once
/// enforces structurally — not a share.
/// The probe's cost, phase by phase. Each phase blocks on the transport, so
/// on a network source these are transport numbers, not CPU numbers.
