/// `URLContext.interrupt_callback` (`libavformat/avio.c:515`), which is copied
/// from the format context **when the URLContext is created during
/// `avformat_open_input`** (`avio.c:189`). A callback set on the
/// `AVFormatContext` afterwards reaches only the few call sites that consult
/// `s->interrupt_callback` directly — not the blocking reads, which is where a
/// stall actually sits. 1.1.1 made exactly that mistake: its bounded
/// index-load seek installed the guard post-open and never bounded anything
/// (issue #39). So the guard now exists *before* the open, permanently, and
/// stays disarmed until someone has a deadline to enforce.
///
/// Disarmed is the resting state on purpose: the callback runs on every
/// blocking read for the context's whole life, including hours of normal
/// production reads, and must never abort those.
///
/// **Lifetime**: the callback holds an *unretained* pointer to this object, so
/// whoever owns the context must keep its guard alive until the context is
/// closed — `ProbedSource` stores it next to the context and the remuxer keeps
/// it for the span of `run()`.
