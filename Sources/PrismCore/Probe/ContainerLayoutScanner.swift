/// Why a hand walk rather than libavformat. There is no public API for any of
/// this: `AVFormatContext` exposes streams, not the byte layout that produced
/// them, and the two quantities a remote consumer needs (`headerBytes`,
/// `firstClusterOffset`) are defined in the container's coordinates, which
/// only the container's own framing gives. The alternatives were both
/// dishonest — `avio_tell` after the open is the *probe buffer's* position,
/// not the header's length, and the first packet's `pos` is a demuxer-internal
/// convention that differs per format. This walk reads framing headers only:
/// element IDs and their declared lengths. It never parses payloads, so there
/// is no bitstream to get wrong.

/// FFmpeg and without a file — which is also what lets the Matroska and MP4
/// paths be fuzzed like every other hand-written parser in this repository.
