/// The software decode path (roadmap phase 7): demux with libavformat, decode

/// `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` under an `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer`.
///
/// This is where sources go that AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline cannot carry at
/// all — VP9/VP8, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP, VC-1, interlaced H.264. Unlike the rest
/// of PrismCore, it is a *player*, not a service: there is no AVPlayer to hand a
/// URL to, so this type owns the transport and the clock.
///
/// ```swift
/// let pipeline = SoftwarePlaybackPipeline()
/// try pipeline.load(url: webmURL)          // synchronous; call off the main thread
/// // or, after a routing probe: try pipeline.load(probed: probedSource)
/// hostView.layer.addSublayer(pipeline.displayLayer!)
/// pipeline.play()
/// ```
///
/// ## Pacing, and why audio is not gated on video
///
/// Both renderers publish `isReadyForMoreMediaData` and both call back through
/// `requestMediaDataWhenReady`. The obvious loop — one cursor, paced on the
/// *video* renderer's readiness — is a classic pipeline trap: as soon
/// as video stops draining (a backgrounded app, a display layer off screen, a
/// decode that briefly outruns the queue) the gate never reopens, and audio
/// starves behind it even though its own renderer is begging for data. That is
/// audible as a dropout, and it is a coupling bug, not a throughput problem.
///
/// So the loop reads while *either* stream still wants data, decodes into two
/// small pending queues, and each renderer drains its own queue on its own
/// callback. Video being full therefore cannot stop audio from being read,
/// decoded and enqueued; the cost is that chasing audio past a full video queue
/// lets the video queue grow by roughly the container's interleave distance,
/// which a hard cap bounds (see `Pacing`). A pathological interleave stops reads
/// instead of growing memory — the honest failure. An independent
/// audio look-ahead cursor is the refinement this shape leaves room for.
///
/// ## Audio track switching
///
/// `selectAudioTrack(streamIndex:)` swaps the audio decoder mid-playback,
/// leaving the clock and the video renderer untouched (issue #35). The new
/// decoder is built *before* the old one is torn down — a track whose decoder
/// can't open leaves the current track playing rather than leaving silence —
/// and the demuxer is then rewound to the clock's present so the new track
/// starts where the listener is, not where the read cursor had run ahead to.
/// The rewind re-reads video the renderer already holds; those frames are
/// dropped by timestamp instead of re-enqueued, which is what keeps the video
/// path a bystander. On a source that refuses the rewind (no index), the new
/// track joins at the read position instead — a gap of the queue's look-ahead,
/// which beats refusing the switch.
///
/// ## Not here yet
///
/// Subtitle rendering belongs to the host: poll `activeSubtitleCues` for an
/// overlay. Bitmap subtitles and external subtitle files are not selected here.
/// `.ended` fires from a synchronizer
/// boundary at the last presentation end — when the speaker has finished the
/// last buffer, not when it was enqueued.
