/// Decides, before a single segment is written, which CEA-608 services this
/// source carries.
///
/// ### Why this has to happen up front
///
/// A caption service only becomes selectable by putting it in the master
/// playlist's `SUBTITLES` group, and the master is written before the copy loop
/// starts — its URIs, codecs and languages are all static. There is no way to
/// add a rendition to a manifest AVPlayer has already read. So the question
/// "does this file have captions, and on which channels" has to be answered
/// from packets, before the muxer exists.
///
/// ### The cost, stated honestly
///
/// Absence cannot be proven cheaply: nothing in a container declares that its
/// video carries no captions, so the only answer is to look. This reads at most
/// `maximumVideoPackets` video packets — around a second of pictures — and then
/// the caller rewinds. On a captioned source it usually stops far sooner, at
/// the first printed character. That is the whole added startup cost, paid once
/// per session, and it buys the copy loop the right to do nothing at all for a
/// source that has no captions: no reader is built, and the per-packet tap is
/// never installed.
///
/// The scan is skipped outright unless the stream is H.264 or HEVC **and** the
/// input is seekable — an unseekable live source cannot be rewound, and a
/// second of video lost off the head of a live stream is a worse trade than a
/// caption track nobody asked for.
