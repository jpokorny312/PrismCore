/// One subtitle rendition on disk: `subs<N>/seg%05d.vtt` segments plus
/// `subs<N>/index.m3u8`, cut on the **same wall-time boundaries as the video
/// segments** so the two playlists line up 1:1 (what AVPlayer expects of a
/// `SUBTITLES` rendition, and what keeps its segment fetches predictable).
///
/// ### Timeline and `X-TIMESTAMP-MAP`
///
/// WebVTT cue times are local to the file, so HLS bridges them to the media
/// timeline with `X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:<t>,LOCAL:<local>`: the player reads it
/// as "local time `LOCAL` is media timestamp `t`", where `t` is on a **90 kHz**
/// axis regardless of what timescale the media segments use (RFC 8216 §3.5).
///
/// Our media segments are fMP4 carrying the source's own stream-copied
/// timestamps, so the media timeline starts at the source's first video PTS —
/// there is no MPEG-TS 10 s convention to honour here, and assuming one is
/// exactly the bug that makes fMP4 subtitle tracks render ~10 s late elsewhere.
/// So:
///
/// - cue times are written **relative to the presentation origin** (the first
///   video PTS), i.e. a cue one second into playback prints `00:00:01.000`;
/// - every segment repeats `MPEGTS:round(origin × 90000),LOCAL:00:00:00.000`,
///   which is the offset that carries the origin back onto the media axis.
///
/// For the ordinary source whose first PTS is 0 that reduces to `MPEGTS:0`, and
/// for a mid-stream capture starting at 10 s it prints `MPEGTS:900000` because
/// the video really does start there — the map states a fact about the output
/// rather than a convention.
