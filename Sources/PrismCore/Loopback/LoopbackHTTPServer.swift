/// A minimal HTTP/1.1 server bound to `127.0.0.1` on an ephemeral port — the
/// loopback half of the remux pipeline. It serves exactly one namespace (the
/// remux session's segment dir by default): the growing playlist, the init
/// segment, and the media segments.
///
/// Still deliberately small, but no longer naive about what AVPlayer does to a
/// server at scale:
///
/// - **`GET` and `HEAD`**; anything else is `405`.
/// - **Whole-payload responses** with `Content-Length` (`Range` is ignored —
///   HLS clients fetch whole segments).
/// - **Keep-alive** per HTTP/1.1 default: after a response the connection loops
///   back to reading the next request, bounded by `Limits.maxRequestsPerConnection`
///   and `Limits.idleTimeout` so abandoned sockets can't pile up. `Connection:
///   close` (and HTTP/1.0 without an explicit keep-alive) is honored.
/// - **A provider seam** (`SegmentProvider`) instead of direct file reads, so a
///   payload that is still being produced can say so.
///
/// The reason the seam exists is an expensive AVPlayer lesson:
/// AVPlayer's media watchdog logs `-12889 "No response for media file"` after
/// roughly 3.5 s without response HEADERS — holding the socket open silently
/// buys nothing — and a few of those in a row fail the item outright. So when a
/// provider hasn't answered within `Limits.slowServeThreshold` (2 s, comfortably
/// inside the window), the server commits to an early `200` with
/// `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` and sends the payload as a single chunk when it
/// lands. If the serve ultimately misses, the connection is aborted mid-body:
/// a truncated transfer is something AVPlayer retries, whereas a well-framed
/// empty `200` is something it caches as the truth about that segment.
///
/// Fast serves keep the byte-identical `Content-Length` shape — the chunked
/// path is the exception, not the norm.
///
/// ## Reachability
///
/// The default (`Reachability.loopbackOnly`) is the whole story above: bound to
/// `127.0.0.1`, unreachable from anywhere else, no token, byte-identical to
/// what shipped before this mode existed.
///
/// `.localNetworkUnencryptedForAirPlay` is the opt-in exception, and it exists
/// for exactly one reason: when the host AirPlays to an external receiver, the
/// receiver fetches the playlist and every segment *itself*, and `127.0.0.1`
/// resolves to the receiver. See that case's documentation for what it costs.
