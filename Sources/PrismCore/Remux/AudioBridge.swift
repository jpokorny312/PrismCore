/// Decode → resample → re-encode for audio the HLS-fMP4 pipeline can't
/// stream-copy (roadmap phase 3).
///
/// `HLSRemuxer` copies AAC/AC3/EAC3/FLAC/ALAC bit-for-bit — that path must never
/// change, because it's the one that keeps Atmos objects alive. Everything else
/// (TrueHD, MLP, DTS, DTS-HD MA, MP3, MP2, Opus, Vorbis, PCM) is either illegal
/// in ISOBMFF/HLS or something AVPlayer won't decode, so v0 either dropped it or
/// fell back to a lesser compatibility track. This bridge gives those sources a
/// track AVPlayer *does* take, in surround.
///
/// Target codec is **EAC3 at 128 kbps per channel** (256 stereo, 768 for 5.1).
/// The reasoning is about the sink, not the file: AVPlayer hands an encoded
/// EAC3 elementary stream to HDMI as a bitstream, so a soundbar or a basic AVR
/// decodes its own 5.1 — which is the majority install base. The lossless
/// alternative (FLAC 7.1) makes AVPlayer emit multichannel LPCM, and a route
/// that only accepts stereo LPCM silently downmixes it, i.e. the lossless
/// choice is the one that loses surround more often. Object metadata is gone
/// either way: FFmpeg's EAC3 encoder produces no JOC, so a TrueHD-MAT or
/// DTS:X source arrives here already reduced to its channel bed. That's an
/// accepted downgrade for tracks that otherwise wouldn't play at all — a real
/// EAC3+JOC source never enters this class, it stream-copies.
///
/// Shape of the pipeline, and why each stage exists:
///
/// ```
/// compressed packets ─► decoder ─► swresample ─► av_audio_fifo ─► EAC3 encoder ─► packets
///                                  (to FLTP,      (1536-sample     (encoder tb =
///                                   48 kHz,        framing)         1/sample_rate)
///                                   negotiated
///                                   layout)
/// ```
///
/// - The resampler is unavoidable: the encoder wants FLTP at one of its
///   supported rates, decoders hand out whatever they like (S32P for the
///   lossless XLL/MLP family, FLTP for Opus/Vorbis, S16 for MP2, …).
/// - The FIFO is unavoidable too: FFmpeg's EAC3 encoder is a fixed-frame-size
///   encoder (1536 samples/frame) with neither `VARIABLE_FRAME_SIZE` nor
///   `SMALL_LAST_FRAME`, and one decoded TrueHD/DTS frame is nothing like 1536
///   samples. Feeding it a short frame is an immediate `EINVAL`, so PCM is
///   accumulated and handed over in exact frames.
/// - Timestamps ride the encoder's own time base (1/sample_rate) and are
///   *anchored on the source*, never counted from zero: the caller rescales the
///   emitted packets onto the output stream. A zero-based audio timeline inside
///   fragments whose video carries real source PTS is the classic way to make
///   AVPlayer accept a playlist and then play nothing.
///
/// Availability: this needs FFmpeg's `eac3` encoder, which stock MPVKit does
/// **not** compile in (it ships the ac3/eac3 *decoders* only).
/// `isEncoderAvailable` reports that honestly and `HLSRemuxer` keeps its v0
/// fallback when the answer is no — see the notes on that property.
