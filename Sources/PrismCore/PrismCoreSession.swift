/// One playback session: remux `sourceURL` into HLS-fMP4 on disk and serve it
/// from the loopback. The host plays the returned playlist URL with its own
/// `AVPlayer` — PrismCore v0 is a service, not a player (see README).
///
/// ```swift
/// let session = try PrismCoreSession(url: mkvURL)
/// let playlist = try await session.start()
/// player.replaceCurrentItem(with: AVPlayerItem(url: playlist))
/// …
/// await session.stop()
/// ```
///
/// The URL that comes back is the **master** playlist whenever the source has
/// audio worth carrying as alternate renditions (`master.m3u8`), and the media
/// playlist (`index.m3u8`) when it hasn't — a silent source, or one whose master
/// couldn't be written honestly (see `HLSRemuxer`). Hosts should treat the URL as
/// opaque: the shape is a property of the source, not of the API.
///
/// ## The tvOS playback contract
///
/// On tvOS the panel's HDMI mode has to be programmed **before** AVPlayer sees
/// the playlist — tvOS validates an HDR variant's `VIDEO-RANGE` against the
/// panel's *current* mode, synchronously, so a PQ master handed to an
/// SDR-parked panel fails outright (`-11848`/`-11868`) instead of switching or
/// tone-mapping. The order that works:
///
/// ```swift
/// let playlist = try await session.start()
/// if let choice = await session.displayCriteria {   // 1. program the panel
///     criteriaController.apply(choice)
///     await criteriaController.waitForSwitch()      // 2. let it settle
/// }
/// player.replaceCurrentItem(with: AVPlayerItem(url: playlist))  // 3. then load
/// player.play()
/// ```
///
/// AVKit's `appliesPreferredDisplayCriteriaAutomatically` must be `false` for
/// these sessions: it derives criteria from the chosen variant's format
/// description, which only exists *after* the variant passes the very
/// validation the switch has to precede — and its late write races the one
/// above into a double handshake. `MasterRejection` remains the backstop for
/// the panel states no read can prove (Match Content off on an HDR panel).

    ///   soon as the successor's playlist is loaded.

    ///   live sessions over one directory means two producers writing segment
