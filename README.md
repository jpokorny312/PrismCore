## What it is

Any container libavformat can read (MKV, MPEG-TS, AVI, …) is remuxed on the fly
into **HLS-fMP4**, served from a loopback HTTP server on `127.0.0.1`, and handed
to a plain `AVPlayer` as a playlist URL. Not a single frame is re-encoded. Apple's
stack then does what only it can do on its own platforms:

- **hardware decode** (VideoToolbox),
- **Dolby Atmos passthrough** — EAC3+JOC is stream-copied, never decoded to PCM,
- **Dolby Vision** display engagement and the HDMI handshake,
- **Match Content** (frame rate + dynamic range) on tvOS,
- system-side HDR10 / HLG tone-mapping,
- and everything that rides along for free because it *is* AVPlayer: Picture in
  Picture, AirPlay, the Now Playing surface, spatial audio.

On Apple platforms the usual choice is between AVPlayer — deep OS integration,
but only Apple's containers — and an mpv- or VLC-derived engine, which plays
almost anything but renders its own frames and decodes audio to PCM, so Dolby
Vision and Atmos die at its door. PrismCore is the third option: FFmpeg's
container breadth in front of Apple's own playback stack.

For the handful of sources whose *video* AVPlayer cannot decode at all (VP9,
MPEG-2, VC-1, interlaced H.264), there is a software path — libavcodec into
`AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` — so a host has one engine to call rather than two.

## Used by

- **[Aether](https://aetherplayer.com)** — a native media player for Apple
  platforms. PrismCore is the engine every non-Apple container routes through:
  ahead of libmpv, behind plain AVFoundation for the files it can already open.
  The remux path is on by default there; the software path is opt-in.

## What it handles

| Area | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Containers | Anything libavformat demuxes — MKV, MP4, MPEG-TS, AVI, WebM, FLV, … |
| Video (native) | H.264, HEVC (incl. Main 10), AV1 **where the device has a hardware decoder** — asked with `VTIsHardwareDecodeSupported`, not inferred from a chip name |
| Video (software) | VP9 / VP8, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2, VC-1 / WMV3, AV1 without hardware (libdav1d), interlaced H.264 with CPU `bwdif` deinterlace at field rate |
| HDR | HDR10 (PQ) and HLG, signaled honestly in the master playlist and tone-mapped by the system |
| Dolby Vision | Profile 5 (`dvh1` sample entry), 8.1 and 8.4 (`hvc1` + `SUPPLEMENTAL-CODECS`), **Profile 7 converted to single-layer 8.1** through libdovi; 8.2's Rec.709 base plays as plain SDR because that is what it is |
| HDR10+ | ST 2094-40 SEI is stream-copied like any other SEI. Opt-in **detection** (`hdr10Plus: .standard` on `SourceProbe.open`) reads a bounded run of video packets and reports `seen` / `notSeenWithinBudget` / `unknown` in `SourceInfo.hdr10Plus` — never "absent". Reporting only: no playlist or display-criteria signalling until a device run shows it helps |
| Dolby Atmos | EAC3+JOC **stream-copied**, and the `dec3` box's TS 103 420 type-A extension re-applied to the init segment — without it AVFoundation plays the same bitstream as plain DD+ |
| Audio (copy) | AAC, AC3, EAC3, FLAC, ALAC — bit-for-bit |
| Audio (bridge) | TrueHD / MLP / DTS / DTS-HD MA / MP3 / MP2 / Opus / Vorbis / PCM → EAC3 5.1, 128 kbps per channel. Needs an FFmpeg build with the **`eac3` encoder**; without it those sources take the software path instead, which decodes them itself |
| Multi-audio | Every viable track becomes an HLS alternate rendition with its language, name and channel count, so AVPlayer gets a real `AVMediaSelectionGroup` to switch on. `preferredAudioLanguage:` decides which one is `DEFAULT`, so playback starts in the right language instead of switching visibly after it. The software path switches too: `SoftwarePlaybackPipeline.selectAudioTrack(streamIndex:)` swaps the decoder mid-playback without touching the clock or the picture |
| Dialogue boost | Opt-in (`dialogueBoost:` on the session): extra "Dialogue Boost" renditions derived from the default track — which is the `preferredAudioLanguage:` track when one matched — decoded, centre channel favoured (bed −6 dB / −12 dB), re-encoded to EAC3 — marked `public.accessibility.enhances-speech-intelligibility` so hosts find them by characteristic. Engine-side because AVFoundation ignores `audioMix`/audio taps on HLS items. The base track stays bit-for-bit (Atmos included). Needs the `eac3` encoder and a centre-channel source; stereo would need `dialoguenhance`, which current builds don't ship |
| Subtitles (text) | SubRip / ASS / SSA / WebVTT / mov_text converted during the remux read into segmented WebVTT renditions, cut on the video's own boundaries — so text survives PiP and AirPlay instead of living in a host overlay. ASS inline italics / bold / underline become WebVTT tags; `\an` / `\pos` placement and a WebVTT track's own cue settings ride the timing line, so a caption authored at the top of the frame stays there. External `.srt` / `.vtt` register as first-class renditions |
| Subtitles (bitmap) | PGS / DVB / DVD read by on-device Vision OCR into the same rendition machinery. Lossy by design — typography dies, text survives — and the raw tracks stay surfaced for a host that wants to draw them pixel-accurately |
| Closed captions (CEA-608) | Captions embedded in the **video** — A/53 `cc_data` in H.264 / HEVC SEI, the form US broadcast recordings, MPEG-TS captures and many disc rips carry — decoded during the remux read into the same WebVTT rendition machinery, so CC1…CC4 appear as real `AVMediaSelectionOption`s and survive PiP, AirPlay and external display. Pop-on, roll-up and paint-on, the full basic / special / extended character sets, labelled by channel and by the video track's language where it declares one. Caption bytes are reordered from decode to presentation order before decoding, which is what keeps them from drifting on any source with B-frames. A bounded packet scan before the first segment decides whether a source has captions at all — one that does not pays nothing in the copy loop. Styling (colour, italics, underline) and cell-accurate positioning are dropped on purpose, so the system caption renderer applies the viewer's own accessibility style |
| Closed captions (CEA-708) | **Not decoded.** DTVCC packets are recognised in `cc_data` and skipped. A 708 service decode means the window model — eight windows with their own anchors, sizes, pen states and row locks — and a partial one puts text on screen in the wrong place while presenting itself as a caption track. Because effectively every 708 encoder also emits the 608 compatibility bytes, this costs nothing on real content; a stream that carries *only* 708 gets no caption rendition rather than a broken one |
| Seek & cache | Keyframe-aligned segment plan published upfront, demand-driven production with re-anchoring, absolute-`tfdt` continuity across restarts, byte-budgeted retention (1 GiB default; an evicted segment is reproduced on demand, so the budget bounds disk, not seekability) |
| Chapters | Matroska `Chapters` / MP4 chapter tracks reported as `SourceInfo.chapters` and `PrismCoreSession.chapters` (title + start/end seconds) — HLS cannot carry them, so they are the host's to draw as timeline markers and skip controls |
| Display | tvOS HDMI handshake driven by the engine: `preferredDisplayCriteria` programmed and settled **before** the item is loaded, which is the only ordering tvOS accepts for HDR HLS |
| Scrub previews | `SeekPreviewService` decodes the keyframe covering any position into a `CGImage` for a custom player HUD — its own context, CPU-only, cached per keyframe, and independent of which engine is playing. The trick-play answer for sources with no server-generated previews |
| Streaming | HTTP headers ride the demux connection (a Plex token, a WebDAV authorization), reconnect on dropped connections |
| Custom input | A host that holds the bytes itself — an SMB mount through its own client, a debrid/torrent session, an encrypted store, a file inside a disc image — implements `PrismCoreInput` (`read` / `seek` / `length`) and passes a factory as `input:` to the session, the probe or `SeekPreviewService`. One instance per open, so the probe, the producer and a scrub preview never share a cursor; host errors surface as `PrismCoreInputError`. An input with no `length` is refused (`.notSeekable`) rather than serving a plan it cannot honour. Omit it and the engine reads exactly as before |

## Quick start

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Wenzlik/PrismCore.git", from: "3.0.0")
```

One call probes the source, picks the path and hands back something already
started:

```swift
import PrismCore

switch try await PrismCoreEngine.open(url: mkvURL) {
case .remux(let session, let playlist):
    player.replaceCurrentItem(with: AVPlayerItem(url: playlist))   // AVPlayer plays it
    …
    await session.stop()

case .software(let pipeline):
    hostView.layer.addSublayer(pipeline.displayLayer!)             // we play it
    pipeline.play()
    …
    pipeline.stop()
}
```

The remux path is the one that matters — it is what buys hardware decode, Atmos
passthrough and Dolby Vision. Drive it directly when you want the detail:

```swift
let session = try PrismCoreSession(url: mkvURL, display: .current())

// optional, before start(): a sidecar joins the WebVTT renditions
try await session.addExternalSubtitle(url: srtURL, language: "cs", name: "Čeština")

let playlistURL = try await session.start()   // .../master.m3u8 or .../index.m3u8
// hand playlistURL to your AVPlayer
…
await session.stop()
```

The URL is a **master** playlist when the source has audio (that is where the
selectable renditions live) and a media playlist when it hasn't. Treat it as
opaque: the shape is a property of the source, not of the API.

### Watching startup happen

`start()` can take seconds on a slow origin. Register **before** it and you get
the stages as they land, each with the time since the call:

```swift
let session = try PrismCoreSession(url: mkvURL, display: .current())

let checkpoints = try await session.startupCheckpoints()   // before start()
Task {
    for await mark in checkpoints {
        switch mark.phase {
        case .sourceOpened:                      status = "Opening…"
        case .streamInfoResolved(let info):      status = info.video?.codecName ?? "…"
        case .segmentPlanReady(let origin, _):   status = origin == .sequential
                                                     ? "Indexing on first play…" : "Preparing…"
        case .firstVideoSegmentWritten:          status = "Starting playback…"
        case .playlistServable:                  break
        }
        log("\(mark.elapsed) \(mark.phase)")    // where the twenty seconds went
    }
    // The stream ends here — on success, on failure, and on stop().
}

let playlistURL = try await session.start()
```

There is no percentage, on purpose: nothing can know in advance how long a probe
over a slow origin takes, and this engine does not report numbers it cannot
measure. Stages with timestamps are things that happened.

`PrismCoreEngine.decide(for:)` is exposed separately, so a host can ask which
path a source would take — and unit-test its own routing — without standing up
either engine.

### Preferred audio and subtitle language

A host that knows which language the viewer wants says so when it builds the
session, and the served master starts in it:

```swift
let session = try PrismCoreSession(
    url: mkvURL,
    display: .current(),
    preferredAudioLanguage: "cs",        // "cze", "ces", "cs-CZ" mean the same
    preferredSubtitleLanguage: "cs"
)
```

Without them the rendition that carries `DEFAULT` is whichever track the
*source* listed first, so a viewer who wants Czech mounts the item, hears
English, and switches — a visible wrong-language moment at every start, and on
the remux path a switch also costs a rendition fetch.

- **Audio.** The matching track becomes the master's `DEFAULT` rendition, above
  every other signal the engine uses to guess (the container's *original* and
  *default* flags, the demuxer's "best stream"). Because dialogue boost derives
  from the default track, it derives from this one.
- **Subtitles.** The matching rendition is the only one ever marked
  `DEFAULT=YES,AUTOSELECT=YES`, which is what makes AVKit engage it at load
  rather than starting with subtitles off. A full rendition wins the flag over
  a forced one of the same language; `FORCED` itself is untouched. Don't pass
  this together with `setTimedTextCueHandler` unless the host suppresses its
  own overlay — otherwise AVKit and the host both draw the cues.
- **Matching is tolerant.** ISO 639-2/B (`cze`), 639-2/T (`ces`) and 639-1
  (`cs`) are one language; a bare tag matches a regioned one (`pt` ↔ `pt-BR`)
  and an exact region wins over a bare one; `und` and an empty tag are not
  languages and match nothing.
- **A no-match is a no-op**, never an error and never an empty selection: the
  source's own default stands. Nothing is ever dropped — every viable track is
  still an alternate rendition — and no decode, bridge or stream-copy decision
  changes. A preferred track this build can neither copy nor bridge is passed
  over, because a rendition AVPlayer cannot play is worse than the wrong
  language.

### Software track menus and captions

`SoftwarePlaybackPipeline` publishes the probe's metadata on the live player.
Audio selection works while playing or paused; the decoder is opened before
replacing the current one, the audio renderer is flushed, and the clock and
video renderer stay in place. The bounded rewind uses the playhead and the
configured audio delay. A refused rewind joins at the demux read position;
network and decoder latency can leave an audible gap. No gapless claim is made.

```swift
let audioTracks = pipeline.selectableAudioTracks   // language, title, channelCount
let subtitleTracks = pipeline.selectableSubtitleTracks // embedded text only
let audioSelection = pipeline.selectedAudioStreamIndex
let subtitleSelection = pipeline.selectedSubtitleStreamIndex // nil = Off

if let track = audioTracks.first {
    pipeline.selectAudioTrack(streamIndex: track.streamIndex) { accepted in
        // Completion is on the feed queue. Dispatch UI work to the main queue.
    }
}
pipeline.selectSubtitleTrack(streamIndex: subtitleTracks.first?.streamIndex)
pipeline.selectSubtitleTrack(streamIndex: nil)     // Off

// In the host's periodic UI update, replace the overlay with this snapshot.
// An empty array means clear it; overlapping cues can produce several entries.
let captions = pipeline.activeSubtitleCues
```

Use source **stream indices**, not positions in the menu array. Read the settled
selection after completion. A same-track selection succeeds without a flush;
invalid indices and calls outside paused/playing state are refused. An audio
open failure preserves the current track. A later read/decode failure reports
`false` and `.failed`; inspect `failureError`. Do not call synchronous `stop()`
or `load()` from feed-queue callbacks.

Text starts Off, including forced tracks: the host chooses its language policy.
All supported text packets use the existing HLS text converter and are retained
in a bounded look-ahead cache, so selecting an already-read caption (or Off)
does not seek, flush A/V, or start a paused clock. `TimedTextCue` timestamps here
use the **source axis**, matching `pipeline.currentTime`; remux cue callbacks
use the origin-rebased AVPlayer axis. Cue payloads can contain WebVTT inline tags
and entities; the host supplies rendering. `TimedTextCue.placement` carries the
placement the source asked for (`TextCuePlacement`: a numpad alignment, plus an
anchor point from `\pos` or a WebVTT `line:`/`position:` pair) — `nil` for the
host's default, which is what nearly every cue wants. Polling clears expired
cues even at EOF or while the demuxer is waiting for data.

The cache holds at most 1,024 cues / 1 MiB of UTF-8 text across all tracks;
expired cues are removed and excess incoming cues are dropped. Cues need valid
PTS and positive duration. Seeking clears the cache and repopulates from the
landing keyframe: a long caption whose packet precedes that keyframe may be
missing until the next cue. Bitmap/OCR and external subtitle selection remain
outside this software surface. ASS colours, fonts, karaoke and drawing overrides
are not preserved by the text converter — only the inline styles and placement
WebVTT has words for.

### Host setup on tvOS

Over HDMI the panel's mode has to be programmed **before** AVPlayer sees the
playlist. tvOS validates an HDR variant's `VIDEO-RANGE` against the panel's
*current* mode synchronously, so a PQ master handed to an SDR-parked panel fails
outright (`-11848` / `-11868`) instead of switching or tone-mapping. AVKit's
`appliesPreferredDisplayCriteriaAutomatically` cannot help here: it derives
criteria from the chosen variant's format description, which only exists after
the variant passes the very validation the switch has to precede. So it must be
`false`, and the order is engine-driven:

```swift
let controller = DisplayCriteriaController(window: window)   // tvOS only
let session = try PrismCoreSession(url: source, display: .current())
let playlist = try await session.start()

if let choice = await session.displayCriteria {
    controller.apply(choice)                 // 1. program the panel
    await controller.waitForSwitch()         // 2. let the handshake settle
}
player.replaceCurrentItem(with: AVPlayerItem(url: playlist))  // 3. only then load
player.play()
// on teardown: controller.reset()
```

`session.displayCriteria` is clamped to the display the session was built for: a
non-DV panel is asked for the base layer's range, a non-HDR panel for a rate-only
switch — which is also what makes **Match Frame Rate** engage on SDR content.
After the handshake, `controller.currentPanelIsHDR()` is the value to feed back
into `DisplayCapabilities(panelIsCurrentlyHDR:)` for the next session.

Built-in panels (iPhone, iPad, Mac) engage HDR on demand and skip all of this.
`PrismCoreSession.isMasterRejection(_:)` plus `makeMuxedFallbackSession()` stays
as the backstop for the one state no API can prove: Match Content switched off on
an HDR-capable panel.

### Knowing why a session failed

`PrismCoreError.classify(_:)` turns anything this engine (or the host's
`AVPlayer`) threw into one machine-readable case, so a failure can be acted on
rather than logged:

```swift
do {
    let playlist = try await session.start()
    …
} catch {
    switch PrismCoreError.classify(error) {
    case .originRefused:                     await refreshToken()
    case .originRateLimited(_, let after, _): await backOff(after ?? 5)
    case .videoCodecNotRemuxable:            routeToSoftwarePath()
    case .masterRejectedByPlayer:            try await session.makeMasterRejectionFallbackSession()
    default:                                 show(error)
    }
}
```

The cases: `originRefused` (401/403/407), `originRateLimited` (429/503/509, with
the origin's own `Retry-After`), `originUnreachable`, `noVideoStream`,
`videoCodecNotRemuxable`, `videoCodecUnplayable`, `startupBudgetExpired`,
`masterRejectedByPlayer`, `workDirectoryOutOfSpace`, `ffmpeg` (raw code and
message, for the libav* failures with no honest mapping) and `unknown`.
`retryability` is three-valued — `.retryable`, `.permanent`, `.unknown` — because
for a startup budget or a full volume this engine genuinely cannot say, and a
`Bool` would have to invent an answer. After startup, `session.remuxFailure` is
the same classification of `session.remuxError`.

Every case is something the engine observed. Where it cannot separate two
situations they share one case: an origin that never answered and one that
vanished mid-session are both `originUnreachable`, because the evidence at the
failure site is identical — the host knows which it was from whether `start()`
had returned.

## How it works

```
                                    ┌─► video ──► fMP4 segments + index.m3u8
Source URL ──► libavformat demux ───┼─► audio 0 ─► audio0/{init.mp4,seg*.m4s,index.m3u8}
                                    ├─► audio N ─► audioN/…              │  tmp dir
                                    └─► subs  N ─► subsN/seg*.vtt        │
                                              master.m3u8 ───────────────┤
                                                                         ▼

```

The segmentation is ours. MPVKit's libavformat is built without the `hls` muxer,
so `FMP4SegmentWriter` drives the `mp4` muxer with `frag_custom` and cuts where we
say (video keyframes at or after each 6 s boundary), and `MediaPlaylistWriter`
turns those fragments into a playlist. Two production modes exist:

- **Planned (demand-driven)** — the default for seekable VOD. `SegmentPlan` maps
  every segment upfront from the demuxer's keyframe index (trusted only past two
  witnesses: max keyframe gap 60 s, coverage ≥ one target duration), complete
  `PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD` playlists are published before the first packet, and a fetch
  outside the producer's window re-anchors it — `av_seek_frame` to the anchor
  keyframe, fresh muxers with `frag_discont` + `avoid_negative_ts=disabled` so
  `tfdt` carries absolute time and the produced segment sits exactly where the
  playlist promised. After EOF the producer parks and keeps answering demand for
  segments a re-anchor skipped.
- **Sequential** — an EVENT playlist growing head-to-EOF. Used when no trustworthy
  plan exists (live, unknown duration, junk index) and for the muxed-with-bridge
  shape, where re-anchoring would reset an encoder mid-fragment.

A source whose container carries no usable index (a Matroska without Cues, any
MPEG-TS) is stuck sequential on its first play — but the producer reads every
packet anyway, so with `keyframeIndexCacheDirectory` set on the session it
harvests the keyframe map as a by-product and persists it (keyed by URL sans
query + size + duration; bounded LRU). The next play of the same source plans
on that map from its first second, as if the file had an index — and a cache
hit skips the index-load seek entirely.

The loopback server speaks HTTP/1.1 with keep-alive (bounded per connection and by
an idle timeout), `GET` + `HEAD`, and pipelined requests. Payloads come from a
`SegmentProvider` rather than straight off disk, and a provider that answers
`.pending` gets an early `200` + `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` once a serve passes
2 s — keeping response headers inside AVPlayer's ~3.5 s media watchdog window. A
pending serve that ultimately fails aborts the connection (a truncated transfer
makes AVPlayer retry) instead of framing a cacheable empty `200`.

### AirPlay to an external receiver

The server binds `127.0.0.1` by default, which is right for playback on the
device and wrong for AirPlay: when the host routes to an Apple TV or an
AirPlay 2 TV, the **receiver** fetches the playlist and every segment itself,
and `127.0.0.1` resolves to the receiver. The master playlist — native WebVTT
renditions, alternate audio, the lot — is simply unreachable.

Opt in per session when, and only when, that is the route:

```swift
let session = try PrismCoreSession(
    url: sourceURL,
    display: .current(),
    reachability: .localNetworkUnencryptedForAirPlay
)
let playlist = try await session.start()
// http://10.0.0.7:51234/<32-char token>/master.m3u8
```

- **Interface** — `getifaddrs`, IPv4 only, up *and* running, no loopback and no
  point-to-point links; tunnels (`utun`, `ipsec`, `ppp`), the peer-to-peer
  radios (`awdl`, `llw`, `nan`), Apple silicon's internal `anpi` links and
  self-assigned `169.254/16` addresses are excluded outright. A real `en`
  interface wins, then anything unrecognized, and an Internet Sharing or VM
  `bridge` last; ties break on the interface's own number, so the choice is
  deterministic. The server binds that one address rather than `0.0.0.0`, so a
  VPN or a shared-internet bridge is never exposed. No interface left →
  `start()` throws `LoopbackHTTPServer.NoLocalNetworkInterface` instead of
  publishing a URL nobody can reach.
- **IPv6 is deliberately not supported.** A literal needs brackets in a URL, a
  link-local one needs a `%zone` receivers handle inconsistently, and the
  platform rotates temporary privacy addresses on its own schedule — which
  would make "the address changed mid-session" routine. Every AirPlay receiver
  on a home network is reachable over IPv4.
- **Token** — 192 bits from the system CSPRNG, base64url, as the first path
  component of every URL (`X-PrismCore-Token` is accepted too, for clients that
  can set headers; an AirPlay receiver cannot). Everything without it is `404`,
  ahead of the method check, and a wrong token is indistinguishable from a
  wrong path so the server is not an oracle. The token buys the session's
  namespace and nothing else: path traversal, the method restriction, the
  request-line and header caps, the per-connection budget and the idle timeout
  all behave exactly as on loopback.
- **The address changing mid-session** (Wi-Fi to Ethernet, a DHCP change, the
  radio dropping) is watched with `NWPathMonitor`. The server does **not**
  re-bind — the URL is already baked into the `AVPlayerItem` and every segment
  reference — it answers `503` and publishes `session.serviceAddress ==
  .addressLost(…)`. A host that sees that should stop the session and start a
  new one. An address that comes back resumes serving.

**The residual risk, plainly: this is cleartext HTTP on the local network.**
Anyone on that LAN who can observe the traffic sees the token, the playlist and
the media bytes, and anyone holding the token can fetch the session's segments
for as long as it runs. The token makes the server unguessable, not private.
Enable the mode for the duration of an AirPlay route on a network the user
trusts, and stop the session when the route ends. Sessions that never AirPlay
should never enable it — the default is unchanged and unreachable off-device.

### Design notes

The things that were expensive to learn, kept here so the next person doesn't pay
for them twice.

**Atmos needs a box FFmpeg drops.** The `CHANNELS="16/JOC"` playlist attribute is
necessary but it is not what engages Atmos. AVFoundation takes the Dolby/MAT route
only when the **`dec3` box** in the init segment carries the TS 103 420 type-A
extension — and FFmpeg's mp4 muxer drops that extension on a stream copy (plain
`ffmpeg -c copy` does the same). So `EAC3Syncframe` reads `complexity_index_type_a`
out of the bitstream's `addbsi` and `EAC3Configuration.patch` appends it to the
produced init segment, re-framing every enclosing box's size. Field placement
follows libavcodec's `ac3_parser.c` rather than a reading of the spec, and that
mattered three times over: the JOC signal can sit in a *dependent* substream
(Blu-ray-style DD+ puts it there, behind an AC-3 core frame), a dependent substream
carries a `chanmap` field an independent one doesn't, and both the converter-sync
bit and the whole mixing-substream block exist on independent substreams only. Each
omission shifted the walk by a bit or two — and a shifted walk does not fail, it
returns a confident wrong number.

**`hvc1` is a promise the record has to keep.** A stream-copied HEVC track is given
an `hvc1` sample entry explicitly, because FFmpeg's mp4 muxer defaults HEVC to
`hev1` and Apple's HLS rules want `hvc1`. But `hvc1` also asserts that every
parameter set lives in that entry, and Matroska `CodecPrivate` routinely says
otherwise (`array_completeness = 0`) — so `HVCCNormalizer` rewrites the record to
VPS/SPS/PPS in order with completeness asserted. It runs **twice**: once on the
input extradata, and again on the produced init segment, because movenc doesn't
copy our record into the sample entry, it rebuilds one and re-zeroes the flag while
still naming the entry `hvc1`. Sources that keep their parameter sets in band
(`numOfArrays = 0`, common in MP4 and MPEG-TS) get them harvested off the first
keyframes and filled in, since an empty `hvcC` under an `hvc1` entry promises Apple
a decoder configuration that isn't there.

**Dolby Vision is three separate claims that must agree.** The manifest's `CODECS`,
the sample entry's fourcc, and the `dvcC`/`dvvC` box all describe the same track,
and AVPlayer checks them against each other. Profile 5 gets `dvh1` as its sample
entry — its picture is IPT-PQc2, not YCbCr, and an `hvc1` entry over P5 renders the
familiar green-and-purple — while 8.x deliberately keeps `hvc1`, because its base
layer really is plain-HEVC-compatible and the `dvvC` box is what upgrades it.
Claiming `dvh1` there would deny the very fallback that makes 8.1 worth having.
The boxes themselves need `-strict unofficial`: they are Dolby's specification
rather than ISO's, movenc refuses to write them by default, and a DV source without
them is HDR10 with extra bytes.

**WebVTT timing states a fact, not a convention.** HLS bridges cue times to the
media timeline with `X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:<t>,LOCAL:<local>`. Our fMP4 segments
carry the source's own stream-copied timestamps, so the media timeline starts at the
first video PTS — there is no MPEG-TS 10 s convention to honour, and assuming one is
exactly what makes fMP4 subtitles render ten seconds late in other implementations.
PrismCore writes cue times relative to the presentation origin and repeats
`MPEGTS:round(origin × 90000),LOCAL:00:00:00.000` in every segment.

**A flagged interlaced source is often lying.** Broadcast H.264 is routinely flagged
interlaced around progressive frames, so the probe decodes a handful of frames before
believing the flag. Evicting those from the native path would trade hardware decode
and Atmos passthrough for deinterlacing nothing.

### Probe hints: describing a source, and being told about one

Two read-only additions for hosts whose media comes from a server that has
already analysed the same file. Both are opt-in and both default to today's
behaviour exactly.

**Exporting.** `SourceProbe.open(url:structure:)` fills
`ProbedSource.structure` with the container's byte layout and seek index —
where the metadata region ends, where the first media element starts, whether
the container's index lives at the head or the tail, and (at `.full`) the
index itself with a verdict on whether it reaches the end of the file. The
export is for an out-of-process probe reading a local descriptor: `.layout`
re-reads the head and `.full` also pays an index-load seek, which is why
`.none` is the default and a routing probe over a network pays neither.

Nothing in it is inferred. Every field is optional or has an `unknown` case,
and `IndexLocation.none` / `IndexCompleteness.absent` need positive evidence
that a container declares no index — an empty index table at open is not that
evidence. A consumer across a network cannot tell a measurement from a
plausible guess, so this side does not make guesses.

```swift
let probed = try SourceProbe.open(url: url, structure: .full)
probed.structure.firstClusterOffset   // Int64?  — where media begins
probed.structure.indexLocation        // .head / .tail / .none / .unknown
probed.structure.index?.completeness  // .complete / .partial / .absent / .unknown
```

**HDR10+.** No container declares it, so the only honest answer comes from
the bitstream, and it costs reads — which is why it is asked for, like the
structure export, and never paid by a routing probe by default.

```swift
let probed = try SourceProbe.open(url: url, hdr10Plus: .standard)
probed.info.hdr10Plus?.verdict        // .seen / .notSeenWithinBudget / .unknown(reason)
probed.info.hdr10Plus?.applicationVersion
```

`notSeenWithinBudget` means exactly that. The finding changes nothing about
how the source is played: `VIDEO-RANGE` stays PQ, and HDR10+ rides the
stream-copy whether or not anyone asked.

**Consuming.** `SourceProbe.open(_:hints:)` takes what a caller already knows.
`hints: nil` is the unhinted open, unchanged.

```swift
let probed = try SourceProbe.open(url, hints: SourceOpenHints(
    headerBytes: 4312, firstClusterOffset: 5184, indexLocation: .tail
))
probed.hints.firstReadBytes   // what the first read was actually bounded to
probed.hints.rejections       // why a hint was not used — never an error
```

A hint may make this engine do *less* work; it may never make it skip a check.
`headerBytes` and `firstClusterOffset` size the first read and nothing else, so
a stale value costs a read rather than a wrong parse. `expectedValidator` and
`keyframes` exist and are validated in full — the transport's `ETag` is checked
once before any byte is delivered, and a supplied map is checked against the
stream, its exact time base, monotonicity, a cap and the container's bounds —
but a surviving map is carried on `ProbedSource.hints`, not yet consumed by the
planner, and is **never** written into the local keyframe sidecar. A map
computed elsewhere and a map harvested by this machine's own read of the file
are the same numbers with different provenance, and the disk must not lose the
difference.

## Non-goals

Deliberate omissions, so you don't have to read the source to find them:

- **No UI.** No view, no transport bar, no controls, no HUD.
- **No published playback state.** The remux path is a service: it hands you a URL
  and gets out of the way. Your `AVPlayer` remains the source of truth for time,
  rate and status.
- **No subtitle rendering.** Text becomes WebVTT renditions AVPlayer selects
  itself; bitmap tracks are surfaced for a host that wants to draw them.
- **No playlist or queue management.** Make a new session for the next title.
- **No analytics.** Nothing leaves the device, and nothing phones anywhere.
- **No re-encoding of video, ever.** If a frame would have to be touched, that
  source belongs on the software path or somewhere else entirely.

## Requirements

| | Min |
| --- | --- |
| iOS | 16.0 |
| tvOS | 17.0 |
| macOS | 14.0 |
| visionOS | 1.0 |
| Swift | 6.0 |

FFmpeg arrives through [MPVKit](https://github.com/mpvkit/MPVKit)'s **dynamic**
xcframeworks — no FFmpeg source is redistributed here and nothing needs building.
Dolby Vision RPU conversion goes through
[libdovi](https://github.com/quietvoid/dovi_tool), which MPVKit already links.

A host that already ships MPVKit adds **zero new binary dependencies**. One gotcha
if that host vendors its own MPVKit fork: SPM derives a path dependency's identity
from its *directory name*, so the fork's directory has to be called `MPVKit` for it
to override the `mpvkit` identity PrismCore asks for.

### Which FFmpeg answered

`FFmpegBuild` reports the build that is actually loaded — a line per linked
library with the header version beside it whenever the two disagree, FFmpeg's own
version string, and the capability answers that change what this engine does with
a source: the `eac3` encoder (without it the audio bridge cannot run), the AV1
decoder and whether this device has hardware for it, dialogue boost, and the GPU
deinterlacer:

```swift
print(FFmpegBuild.summary)
// FFmpeg n8.1.2
//   libavutil 60.26.102
//   libavcodec 62.28.102
//   …
//   eac3 encoder: NO — audio bridge disabled
//   av1 decoder: libdav1d (hardware: no)
//   dialogue boost: no
//   gpu deinterlacer: none — CPU route
```

Worth a line in a host's launch log and worth attaching to a bug report: half of
what this engine decides is a question about the build rather than the media, so
"audio track is missing" is often unreproducible until you know which FFmpeg was
asked. A host that vendors its own fork should also assert `FFmpegBuild.isABIMatched`
once — a **major** version apart from the headers PrismCore compiled against means
the public structs this engine walks on every packet may be laid out differently,
which surfaces as wrong pixels and wrong timestamps rather than as an error.
PrismCore logs and reports that state but does not refuse to run on it.
`FFmpegBuild.configuration` carries libavcodec's full `configure` line for the
report.

### Reproducing from a terminal

`prismcore-cli` is a macOS tool in this package (not a product a host needs to
link) that runs the engine on one source from the command line:

```
swift run prismcore-cli probe     <url-or-path>   # SourceInfo, structure, routing verdict + reason
swift run prismcore-cli serve     <url-or-path>   # loopback playlist URL for Safari / QuickTime
swift run prismcore-cli bench     <url-or-path>   # the startup checkpoint line a host logs
swift run prismcore-cli segverify <url-or-path>   # decode every served segment on its own
swift run prismcore-cli validate  <url-or-path>   # Apple's mediastreamvalidator, if installed
```

`validate` is opt-in. It needs Apple's HTTP Live Streaming Tools, and without
them it prints a notice and exits 0 (unless you pass `--require-validator`).
The CLI does not replace a device run. The tvOS display handshake, Dolby
Vision on a real panel and Atmos passthrough can only be checked on hardware.
`--help` lists the options, and AGENTS.md *Measuring* explains how to benchmark
honestly.

## Stability and versioning

PrismCore follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Every `public`
declaration in `Sources/PrismCore/` is the stability contract; `internal` types are
not. Since 1.0.0 that contract is a promise: breaking changes bump the major,
features the minor, fixes the patch — so the ordinary pin is the right one:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Wenzlik/PrismCore.git", from: "3.0.0")
```

Hosts that archive through Xcode Cloud (or any CI with automatic resolution
disabled) should pin an exact version and keep their committed `Package.resolved` in
step with it. A `from:` range lets local resolution ride ahead to a newer tag while
the pinned file stays put, and then a device build and a TestFlight build are quietly
running different engines.

Every release is listed in **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**.

## Integrating it

PrismCore is **LGPL-2.1-or-later with an Application Store Exception** (see
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md)). In practice, for the two cases
that come up:

**Shipping a closed-source app, including on the App Store.** Add the package, use
it, ship it. The exception exists precisely for this: LGPL section 6 asks that your
users be able to relink your app against a modified PrismCore, which a signed `.ipa`
cannot allow, and the exception releases you from that requirement for store
distribution. Two things are asked of you in return:

1. If you **modify PrismCore itself**, those modifications stay LGPL and have to be
   published. Using it unmodified — the normal case — carries no such obligation for
   your own code.
2. Say so somewhere a user can find it (an About screen, an acknowledgements page):
   that your app includes PrismCore, under which licence, and where the source
   lives. Aether's About screen is a worked example.

**FFmpeg is a separate obligation, and it is not new.** The exception covers
PrismCore's own code only. FFmpeg reaches your app as dynamically linked frameworks
under plain LGPL-2.1-or-later, which is satisfiable for a closed-source store app —
that is what every FFmpeg-based app on the App Store already does — provided you
embed them *dynamically*, ship the licence texts, and point at the build's source.
If you already ship MPVKit, you are already doing all three.

Why LGPL rather than something permissive: `Sources/PrismCore/Remux/EAC3Syncframe.swift`
was written by reading FFmpeg's `ac3_parser.c`, because the placement of the Atmos
signal in `addbsi` cannot be derived reliably from the specification alone — three
attempts from the spec produced a confidently *wrong* answer. That makes the file
realistically a derivative of LGPL code, and [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) says so out
loud rather than hoping nobody looks.

## Status

Shipping, and pre-1.0 for the reason the version number suggests: the API is still
free to move, and two headline claims are proven by construction rather than by a lab.

The test suite is 253 tests across 44 suites, hermetic apart from an opt-in
real-media harness. It exercises the playlists, the loopback server, the subtitle
renditions and the audio bridge's decode → resample → FIFO → encode chain, plus
end-to-end remuxes of synthetic fixtures: a two-language master (AAC eng + AC3 ces)
is served over the loopback, re-probed through libavformat's `hls` demuxer with both
codecs and both languages intact, and reaches `.readyToPlay` in a real `AVPlayer`.
Bitmap-subtitle OCR is verified against a real Blu-ray remux, where the served
segments read back the film's own SDH cues.

Being precise about the two headline claims, because "implemented" and "proven" are
not the same thing. **Atmos**: EAC3+JOC stream-copies (proved on a fixture — the
codec survives the round-trip), the rendition declares `CHANNELS="16/JOC"` (the rule
is unit-tested), and the served `dec3` declares complexity index 16 on Dolby's own
demo file. Whether the objects reach a receiver over HDMI is a device question.
**Dolby Vision**: the whole signaling path exists and every rule is pinned by a unit
test, but a synthetic fixture cannot carry an RPU, so Profile 7 conversion is
established only as far as "the library links and the code runs". Both want a device
and real media, and that is what the Aether integration is currently buying.

The software path is exercised headless as far as it can be — the VP9 fixture decodes
to `CVPixelBuffer`s of the right shape on a monotonic, source-anchored timeline, and
the pipeline runs demux → decode → stamp → back-pressure → enqueue against renderer
stand-ins, including the case where a stalled video renderer must not starve audio.
Audio track switching is proven the same way: the multi-audio fixture's tracks differ
in channel count (AAC stereo vs AC-3 5.1), so the renderer-side buffers *show* which
track is playing, and the video assertions show the switch never touched the picture.
Text selection is tested against embedded full/forced subtitle tracks, including
paused switching, Off, expiry and a backward seek. What no headless test can
assert is that a frame reached a display or an audio switch was inaudible on a
device. Caption rendering belongs to the host; frame-accurate seek remains open.

## Cache, audio diagnostics and HTTP policy

```swift
let session = try PrismCoreSession(
    url: sourceURL,
    display: .current(),
    audioDelaySeconds: 0.150,       // present audio 150 ms later
    coordinatedHTTP: true          // optional; finite HTTP(S) Range files only
)
let playlist = try await session.start()
let ranges = session.residentRanges
let routes = session.audioTrackDeliveries
let preview = try await session.cachedThumbnail(at: sourceSeconds)
```

`residentRanges` and `cachedThumbnail` use **source timestamps**, including a
nonzero source origin where present. A host must map these onto its player
timeline. These are video-cache ranges, not AVPlayer's loaded ranges or a
promise that a seek has no latency. Cache misses return `nil` without asking
the source for data; previews show the segment's opening picture. Fragments
above 64 MiB also return `nil`. The image cache holds at most 16 MiB / 32 images.

`audioDelivery` summarizes available base routes, while `audioTrackDeliveries`
lists each source track, including an unavailable one. The host owns actual
AVPlayer track selection. A `.bridged` route describes its constructed pipeline;
its `bridge` counters show whether output has actually been produced. Zero
output during priming is normal. A terminal, completely drained silent bridge
raises `AudioBridgeFailure.producedNoAudio` through the session error path.
The software pipeline exposes `.decoded` only after its decoder opens.

Audio delay is fixed at construction and carried by every clone. Changing it
mid-title means a replacement session and a host-managed handover at the current
position — see *Changing a setting mid-title* below. Both positive and negative
offsets are bounded to two seconds; this does not add an AVPlayer transport
controller to PrismCore.
Audio delay can be changed while the title plays — it is a lip-sync control —
and is preserved by fallback factories. Both positive and negative offsets are
bounded to two seconds, and a non-finite value becomes zero. The two paths take
a new value up differently, and each reports which:

```swift
switch session.setAudioDelaySeconds(0.2) {        // remux path
case .pendingReanchor: break   // accepted; in force at the producer's re-anchor
case .inForce: break           // only before start()
case .unsupported: break       // no plan (live, or no usable index): unchanged
case .sessionStopped: break
}
session.audioDelaySeconds          // what is being SERVED right now
session.pendingAudioDelaySeconds   // a request not yet in force, else nil

pipeline.setAudioDelaySeconds(0.2) // software path: in force when it has run
```

On the remux path the engine is serving fMP4 segments written with the previous
offset, and the offset moves audio dts — which cannot step backwards inside a
fragment the muxer is already writing. So the call asks the producer to
re-anchor at the playhead; at that re-anchor the new offset goes in force and
every segment written with the old one is discarded, so a later seek cannot
serve audio at the offset the viewer corrected away from. The picture re-buffers
while production catches up, and AVPlayer plays whatever it had already buffered
at the old offset first — the host should say so in its UI. `audioDelaySeconds`
names only what is in force.

On the software path the offset is applied where a decoded buffer reaches the
renderer: the call flushes the audio renderer and refills it from the source at
the playhead, so the new value is in force as soon as the call has run. The cost
is a gap of decode-to-playhead time, not a re-buffer. The clock, the picture and
the subtitles are untouched on both paths; this does not add an AVPlayer
transport controller to PrismCore.

`coordinatedHTTP` is also available on `PrismCoreEngine.open`,
`SourceProbe.open/openDetached`, `SeekPreviewService` and software `load(url:)`.
Enable it consistently for the readers that should share a server's request
budget. The default remains native FFmpeg I/O. The optional reader uses bounded
1 MiB Range requests and requires valid `206`/`Content-Range` replies; it is not
for live streams, nested HLS playlists or Range-less servers. A redirected
request gets its destination's budget, drops caller headers on a cross-origin
redirect, and refuses HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrade. Thus an authenticated redirect
requiring forwarded custom headers should use the default transport or a final
URL supplied by the host. CDN performance has not been benchmarked.

To run the picture-based seek check on a Mac with AVFoundation rendering:

```sh
PRISMCORE_RENDERED_SEEK=1 DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
  swift test --filter pictureMatchesPlayerClockAfterSeeks
```

The committed `seek_clock.mkv` has a reproducible generator beside it and runs
through a throttled, Range-capable test origin. The check reads actual decoded
frame numbers after seeks; it does not infer success from muxer timestamps.

## Changing a setting mid-title

A session is single-use: the served shape is decided before the first packet and
the output layout follows from it. "Play this differently" — the viewer turns
dialogue boost on, a smaller disk budget, a refused master — therefore means a
new session over the same source. `makeSession(changing:)` mints one from what
this session was built with, so the host does not have to restate it:

```swift
let boosted = try await session.makeSession { $0.dialogueBoost = [.medium] }
let playlist = try await boosted.start()
player.replaceCurrentItem(with: AVPlayerItem(url: playlist))
await player.seek(to: resumeTime)
await session.stop()                       // the caller's job
```

`PrismCoreSession.Options` carries everything the initializers take. Registered
external subtitles and the timed-text cue handler are replayed onto the
successor, and every option the closure leaves alone — the audio delay included
— is carried verbatim. `sourceURL` and `httpHeaders` are read-only: the replay
is what makes them part of a session's identity, and attaching one title's
captions to another file is not a clone.

Three rules, enforced rather than merely documented:

- **Nothing is seamless.** The successor starts from zero. There is no shared
  playhead and no continuity of playback; the host replaces its `AVPlayerItem`
  and seeks to where it wants to resume.
- **The caller still stops the predecessor.** Nothing is stopped for you — at
  the moment of the call the player may still be drawing frames off it. Stop it
  as soon as the successor's playlist is loaded: every live session carries a
  producer reading the source, a server on its own port, and its own
  `segmentCacheBytes` budget.
- **A session mints one successor**; a second call throws
  `SessionError.alreadySuperseded`. Clone the session you are playing, not the
  one you left behind. The successor never inherits the predecessor's work
  directory, which is what keeps two producers from writing the same segment
  names — and keeps `stop()` from deleting a directory somebody is still
  serving from.

`makeMuxedFallbackSession()` and `makeMasterRejectionFallbackSession()` are the
same mechanism with the option preset, and count as that session's one
successor.
